
Here are some routines to do Gregorian labeling of stacked time
series plots, including vector stick plots.

Try using DEMO.M to see how TIMEPLT and STACKLBL work.

IMPORTANT! If you resize the window, you must call TIMEPLT again
to make the labels look right and have the vector sticks have the
right orientation.  Matlab will resize the window when you PRINT,
so you need to ensure that the aspect ratio of the 'paperposition' 
is the same as what the aspect ratio of the figure 'position' is.
A simple way to do this is to use the FIXPAPER command (included
in this distribution) before you print, which will ensure that what
you get on paper is what you see on the screen!
